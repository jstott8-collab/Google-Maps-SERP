## 🌟 Key Features

### 🎯 Precision Tracking
- **Grid-Based Analysis**: Map out rankings (3x3 to 13x13) to see exactly where you dominate and where you disappear.
- **Business Identity Integration**: Auto-populate your business details via search or import via Google Maps URL for pinpoint accuracy.
- **Service Area & Location Support**: Optimized for both physical storefronts and service-area businesses (SABs).

### 🌍 Global Localization
- **Coordinate-Aware Personas**: Automatically adapts browser locale and timezone (e.g., `en-AU` with `Australia/Sydney` timezone) based on the scan target.
- **Forced English Extractions**: Uses `hl=en` globally to ensure consistent data processing regardless of the country being scanned.

### 🛡️ Enterprise Robustness
- **Smart Proxy Management**: Auto-configure proxy pools with intelligent fail-overs.
- **Blacklist Logic**: Faulty proxies are automatically marked as `DEAD` and the system falls back to direct connection to finish the scan.
- **Detailed Telemetry**: Real-time system logs and diagnostic console in Settings for full transparency.

### 📊 Advanced Al-Insights
- **Threat Identification**: Automatically identifies the primary competitor stealing your market share.
- **Geo-Health Analysis**: Detailed reporting on ranking stability and geographic gaps.

## 📝 Latest Updates & Known Issues

### Recent Fixes
- **Unified Profile Scores**: Profile completeness now uses a standardized 0-100% scale.
- **Improved Address Fetching**: Enhanced extraction logic to capture physical addresses more reliably.
- **SAB Detection**: Refined logic to prevent storefronts from being incorrectly flagged as Service Area Businesses.
- **Strategic Analysis**: The Intelligence tab now correctly displays market dominance and competitor threats.

### Known Issues
- **Business Card Addresses**: Addresses inside the individual business cards may still not reflect properly in some views. This will be resolved in a later release. The underlying data extraction is functioning correctly.
