## What Is GBP Rank Tracker?

Google Maps rankings are **hyperlocal**. A business might rank #1 when someone searches from 2 blocks away but rank #15 from 5 miles out. Standard rank checkers only check from a single location and miss this entirely.

**GBP Rank Tracker solves this** by creating a grid of geographic checkpoints around your target area, running real Google Maps searches from each point using browser automation, and mapping every result into a color-coded ranking heatmap.

```
  Green (#1-3)   Orange (#4-10)   Red (#11-20)   Black (not found)
```

Every grid point captures the full top-20 SERP — complete competitive intelligence, not just your own position.

**100% private. 100% free. No API keys. No subscriptions. No data leaves your machine.**

### Intelligence Dashboard

## How It Works

```
1. Open the desktop app
2. Enter your business name or paste your Google Maps URL
3. Choose a keyword (e.g., "plumber near me")
4. Configure your grid (size, shape, radius)
5. Click "Run Scan"
```

The app creates virtual search points across your service area, performs real Google Maps searches from each location using a headless browser, captures the full top-20 results, and maps everything into an interactive heatmap.
